   - Build preset: React

**Option C: Azure CLI**
```bash
az staticwebapp create \
  --name genai-roadmap-yourname \
  --resource-group genai-roadmap-rg \
  --source https://github.com/yourusername/genai-roadmap \
  --location "West Europe" \
  --branch main \
  --app-location "/web-app" \
  --output-location "dist"
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```powershell
.\test-deployment.ps1 -AppUrl "genai-roadmap-yourname.azurestaticapps.net"
```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration
